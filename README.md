## Overview

### Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game is known for its difficulty and simple, yet addictive gameplay. The objective is to navigate the bird through as many pipes as possible to achieve a high score.

## Installation

### To play the game, download the FlappyBirdGame folder and run the FlappyBirdGame.exe file. The game will open in a windowed mode, allowing you to play using the mouse or keyboard.

### If you want to view or modify the source code, download the FlappyBirdGame folder and open the project in the Unity game engine. You can then view and edit the scripts, assets, and scenes to customize the game to your liking.

## Gameplay

### The game starts with the bird positioned at the bottom of the screen, with a pair of green pipes appearing at random heights. The player must click the mouse or press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards. The bird will fall back down due to gravity, so the player must time their flaps carefully to avoid hitting the pipes.

### Each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes, the player earns a point. The game continues until the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, at which point the game ends, and the player's score is displayed. The player can then restart the game by clicking the mouse or pressing the spacebar.

## Game Mechanics

### The game is built using Unity and C# scripting to create the core gameplay mechanics of Flappy Bird. The following scripts are used to control the bird's movement, pipe generation, collision detection, score tracking, and game state management:

- **Bird Movement**: Controls the vertical movement of the bird, including gravity and flap mechanics.
- **Pipe Generation**: Dynamically generates the pipes at regular intervals, ensuring they appear at random heights.
- **Collision Detection**: Checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes or the ground, triggering game over when a collision is detected.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, incrementing it each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
- **Game State Management**: Manages different states of the game such as start, playing, game over, and restart.

### These scripts work together to create the challenging and engaging gameplay experience that Flappy Bird is known for.

## Credits

### This game was created by Jake Fung as a personal project to learn game development using Unity. The game assets, including the bird sprite, pipe sprite, and background image, were sourced from online repositories and modified to fit the game's aesthetic. The sound effects were downloaded from royalty-free sound libraries and added to the game to enhance the player's experience.
