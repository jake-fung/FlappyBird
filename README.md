## Made by Jake Fung

### Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game is known for its difficulty and simple, yet addictive gameplay. The objective is to navigate the bird through as many pipes as possible to achieve a high score.

- **Bird Movement**: Controls the vertical movement of the bird, including gravity and flap mechanics.
- **Pipe Generation**: Dynamically generates the pipes at regular intervals, ensuring they appear at random heights.
- **Collision Detection**: Checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes or the ground, triggering game over when a collision is detected.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, incrementing it each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
- **Game State Management**: Manages different states of the game such as start, playing, game over, and restart.

These scripts work together to create the challenging and engaging gameplay experience that Flappy Bird is known for.
